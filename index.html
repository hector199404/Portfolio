                        <strong>About me</strong>
                        <h4 id="cuerpo">I am a student of the Bachelor's Degree in Professional Networking issued by Cisco on its Cisco Skill for All platform. I obtained my first CCNA certificate. I study Software Development at ULP San Luis. And I have a Python Developer certificate issued by UNSL within the framework of the Argentina 4.0 Program.
                            I dedicate hours to programming and learning about the field day by day, trying to learn to better handle languages ​​and logic.
                            In addition, I am a graphic designer, musician, and haute cuisine chef. I am always excited to learn a little bit of everything, but my focus is on changing my lifestyle and dedicating myself to programming.</h4>

                        <strong>Front-end Developer</strong>
                        <h4 id="cuerpo">I obtained the Responsive Web Developer certification through freeCodeCamp, following the path they recommend and I am still doing it to delve deeper into the technologies. Then through the Youtube channel "PildorasInformáticas" I managed to learn and understand Django to apply what I learned with Python in A.P4.0. and merge it with what I learned in freeCodeCamp.
                            Django as such is one of the technologies that I like to work and learn the most. At the moment I am putting it aside to delve even further into Angular. But I am always writing a new project with Django.</h4>

                        <strong>Python Developer / Back-end Programmer</strong>
                        <h4 id="cuerpo">If there is a language that caught my attention from the beginning, that was Python. It managed to capture my focus and get me to investigate it. I don't remember exactly when it was, but I do remember that I was 12 years old when I first read the Python tutorial when I entered the amazing world of Ubuntu and GNU/Linux. Today it is my secondary system since as a graphic designer, I need to use Windows. But for my root files (images, videos, texts and university studies) I only use GNU/Linux.
                            I want to dedicate myself or would like to dedicate myself 100% to the back-end, I like it more, it is less stressful for me than designing a page visually (I say this from my experience in graphic design). Therefore, I try to learn everything related to the back-end: Django, Python, Docker, PosgreSql, MySql, etc.</h4>

                        <strong>Low-level languages</strong>
                        <h4 id="cuerpo">I recently wanted to start learning low-level languages ​​and I didn't know which one to go for. I had clear options but little or no information about them; my options were C, C++, C# or Java (so I wouldn't have to opt for cobol). After searching for information, I discovered that something I like about the options are the qualities of the languages ​​and the purpose I was going to give them: Back-end. I decided to study C++ and C#, both languages ​​​​help me get into the roots of GNU / Linux and at the same time, the development of something I would like to do and I don't want it to become a frustrated dream: Develop Video Games.
                            With both languages ​​​​I have been studying and making console programs for a little over half a year now, but I hope to integrate Unreal Engine to develop my first video game in 2025.</h4>
